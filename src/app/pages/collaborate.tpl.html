    <h3 class="col-title">Why CIViC?</h3>
    <p>The driving motivation for CIViC is to encourage a sense of collaborative participation in the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our hope is to provide an open forum made by researchers for researchers. The ultimate goal is to arrive at a community consensus for how to interpret genomic alterations in a clinical context for personalized cancer care.</p>

    <h3 class="col-title">How you can contribute:</h3>
    <p>There are several mechanisms by which you can make a contribution to this important problem:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Consume</strong><br/>
        Make use of the community-created content in your own research. All CIViC data and source code are provided freely for almost any use.</li>
      <li><strong>Create</strong><br/>
        Propose a new genomic variant (single nucleotide substitution, structural variant, gene fusion, etc), add evidence statements that support clinical actions assocated with such variants, or help create a synthesized interpretation or summary of the corpus of evidence for a variant.</li>
      <li><strong>Correct</strong><br/>
        Submit a correction to any details about a genomic event, evidence statement or interpretation.</li>
      <li><strong>Comment</strong><br/>
        Participate in an ongoing discussion in an effort to reach community consensus on the appropriate clinical action(s) for a genomic event.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="col-title">CIViC principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We believe that the interpretations of clinical actionability required to enable precision medicine should be freely available and openly discussed across a diverse community.</li>
      <li>An interdisciplinary approach is needed to combine the expertise of genome scientists and health care providers, whose efforts are often isolated.</li>
      <li>Content should be created with transparency, kept current, be comprehensive, track provenance, and acknowledge the efforts of creators.</li>
      <li>The interface should be both structured enough to allow computational data mining and agile enough to handle the product of openly-debated, human interpretation.</li>
      <li>CIViC is committed to provide unencumbered and efficient access to community-driven curation and interpretation of cancer mutations. Curated knowledge will remain free and can be accessed anonymously without login unless the user wishes to contribute to content.</li>
      <li>To encourage both academic and commercial engagement CIViC is released with minimal restrictions under a Creative Commons license (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>). No fees or exclusive access will be introduced. While sharing improvements is strongly encouraged, the data can be adopted and used for nearly any purpose including the creation of commercial applications derived from the knowledge. We require only that attribution be given to the community that created the content.</li>
