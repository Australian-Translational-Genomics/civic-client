    <h3 class="col-title">Why CIViC?</h3>
    <p>The driving motivation for CIViC is to encourage a sense of collaborative participation in the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our hope is to provide an open forum made by researchers for researchers. The ultimate goal is to arrive at a community consensus for how to interpret genomic alterations in a clinical context for personalized cancer care.</p>

    <h3 class="col-title">How you can contribute:</h3>
    <p>There are several mechanisms by which you can make a contribution to this important problem:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Create:</strong><br/>
        Propose a new genomic variant (single nucleotide substitution, structural variant, gene fusion, etc), add evidence statements that support clinical actions assocated with such variants, or help create a synthesized interpretation or summary of the corpus of evidence for a variant.</li>
      <li><strong>Correct:</strong><br/>
        Submit a correction to any details about a genomic event, evidence statement or interpretation.</li>
      <li><strong>Comment:</strong><br/>
        Participate in an ongoing discussion in an effort to reach community consensus on the appropriate clinical action(s) for a genomic event.</li>
