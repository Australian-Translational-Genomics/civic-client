<h1>Collaborate</h1>

<p>The driving motivation for CIViC is to encourage a sense of collaborative participation in the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our hope is to provide an open forum made by researchers for researchers. The ultimate goal is to arrive at a community consensus for how to interpret genomic alterations in a clinical context for personalized cancer care. There are several mechanisms by which you can make a contribution to this important problem:

<ol>
<li>Create content - Propose a new genomic event (mutation, structural variant, etc), evidence statement for clinical action, or interpretation.</li>
<li>Correct - Submit a correction to any details about a genomic event, evidence statement or interpretation.</li>
<li>Comment/Vote - Participate in an ongoing discussion in an effort to reach community consensus on the appropriate clinical action given a genomic event.</li>

</p>
