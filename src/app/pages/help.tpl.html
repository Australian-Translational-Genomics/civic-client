<h2>Understanding the CIViC data model</h2>
<p>
At the heart of CIViC is the clinical evidence statement. The clinical evidence statement is a piece of information that has been manually curated from trustable medical literature about a variant or genomic 'event' that has implications in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, or predictive response to therapy. For example, “Patients with BRAF V600 mutations respond well to the drug dabrafenib”. A variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or deletion, a chromosomal rearrangment, an RNA gene fusion, an RNA expression pattern (e.g. over-expression), and so on. Each clinical evidence statement corresponds to a single citable publication.<br><br>

The following tables define the minimal components and definitions required for a CIViC evidence statement. Once enough clinical evidence statements have been curated, a variant summary is generated describing the variant's significance in cancer, along with current treatment methods. A gene level summary then synthesizes the variant summaries. Each variant can belong to one or more groups.  For example 'FGFR fusions' is a group that contains several gene fusions where FGFR2 (or FGFR3) is involved in a fusion with various 3' partner genes.

<h3>Breaking Down the Evidence Statement</h3>
<p>
When curating evidence statements from published sources, to discern whether a variant has a "clinical interpretation", we use the data model below. Evidence statements can either be predictive of drug response, be correlated with prognostic outcome, or contribute to disease diagnosis. If an evidence item can not be placed in one of these categories, it likely lies outside of the scope of CIViC. However, published statements about a gene or variant that cannot be placed within these categories can still be added to the free-form clinical summary and variant summary.

<h3>Evidence Levels: Overview</h3>
<p>
Each evidence statement is the result of an experiment, trial or study in published literature. It is important to capture the nature of these experiments in the evidence entry. Evidence levels allow for the subject of an evidence item to be presented in a simple, standardized fashion. 

 <table class="table table-striped table-condensed table-responsive table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <th>Level of Evidence</th>
    <th>Definition</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A - Validated association</td>
    <td>Proven/consensus association in human medicine</td>
    <td>A meta-analysis of clinical studies showed that harboring a BRAF V600E mutation predicts worse prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B - Clinical evidence</td>
    <td>Clinical trial or other primary patient data supports association</td>
    <td>In non-small-cell lung cancer patients with EGFR T790M and other activating mutations, their progression-free survival is shorter than those who do not have T790M mutations</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C - Preclinical evidence</td>
    <td>In vivo or in vitro models support association</td>
    <td>Experiments showed that AG1296 is effective in triggering apoptosis in cells with the FLT3 internal tandem repeat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D - Inferential association</td>
    <td>Indirect evidence</td>
    <td>Glioma cells harboring IDH1 mutation may be more susceptible to chemotherapy or radiotherapy due to their reduced ability to respond to oxidative stress</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Star Ratings Explained</h3>
<p>
In order to quickly discern how much trust curators and users have in a single evidence statement, a five star trust ratings system is used. Each evidence item is given a rating, from 1 star to 5, based on the quality of the source from which the evidence is curated. These ratings depend on a number of factors, including journal impact, control quality, orthogonal validation, and reproducibility. 

 <table class="table table-striped table-responsive table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <th>Star Rating</th>
    <th>Definition</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 star</td>
    <td>Claim is not supported well by experimental evidence. Results are not reproducible, or have very small sample size. No follow-up is done to validate novel claims.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 stars</td>
    <td>Evidence is not well supported by experimental data, and little follow-up data is available. Publication is from a journal with low academic impact. Experiments may lack proper controls, have small sample size, or are not statistically convincing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3 stars</td>
    <td>Evidence is convincing, but not supported by a breadth of experiments. May be smaller scale projects, or novel results without many follow-up experiments. Discrepancies from expected results are explained and not concerning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4 stars</td>
    <td>Strong, well supported evidence. Experiments are well controlled, and results are convincing. Any discrepancies from expected results are well-explained and not concerning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 stars</td>
    <td>Strong, well supported evidence from a lab or journal with respected academic standing. Experiments are well controlled, and results are clean and reproducible across multiple replicates. Evidence confirmed using separate methods.</td>
  </tr>
