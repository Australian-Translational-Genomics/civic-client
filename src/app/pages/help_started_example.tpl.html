      <li>Visit <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" title="PubMed Main Page" target="_blank">PubMed</a> to identify the publication's PubMed ID.</li>
      <li>Enter as much information possible to help curators. This form only requires 2 elements: PubMed ID and a comment to direct curators as to why you believe this publication has clinically-relevant information about a variant.</li>
      <li>Your suggested source can be seen in the <a ui-sref="curation.sources" title="Source Suggestion Queue" target="_blank">Source Suggestion Queue</a> or by searching for the publication in the <a ui-sref="search.sources" title="Source advanced search" target="_blank">Source Advanced Search</a> to find the dedicated CIViC publication page.</li>
    </ul>  
    <li>Add a variant Alias.</li>
    <li>Read a summary for your favorite gene/variant and comment on the contents</li>
    <li>Add a Variant Type.</li>
