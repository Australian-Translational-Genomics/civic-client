  Most of the contents of CIViC are curator generated and edited. Below are a few examples of areas where curators are needed, culminating in a list of bite sized curation tasks that should require less than 3 minutes of your time.
  <h4>1. Adding Evidence</h4>
  <p>Evidence records are the heart of the CIViC resource. Each corresponds to evidence for a single clinical assertion about a single variant in a single cancer type. Each evidence record is based on a single citable source (e.g. a peer-reviewed publication). The evidence record consists of a free-form executive summary describing the assertion and supporting evidence for it, and additional structured fields that describe the evidence (e.g. evidence type, relevant drug, etc.). To learn more about the elements of an evidence record refer to the <a ui-sref="help.evidence" title="Evidence help">Evidence help docs</a>. For suggestions on where to find sources for evidence records, refer to the Source Ideas tab of this section. To add a new evidence record, you must login and hit the "ADD" button at the top of any page throughout the site.</p>
  <h4>2. Adding or improving Variant, Variant Group, and Gene Summaries</h4>
  <p>Once evidence sufficient evidence accumulates for a variant, variant group or gene entity, a summary should be created. The summary should be an overview of the evidence records associated with the entity. The summary should focus on the most clinically actionable evidence and should summarize for each relevant gene what a clinician should be aware of for patients with a particular variant, or variants in a particular gene. Very brief background material may be included. Additional citations beyond those associated with the evidence records can be associated directly with the summary using the "Add Source" option.</p>
  <h4>3. Editing CIViC Content</h4>
  <p>CIViC content can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon as displayed for an example Variant below.</p> 
  <h4 class="edit-icon-lg">
    <div class="editableField hover">
      <span class="entity-type">VARIANT </span>
      <span class="entity-name">V600E</span>
    </div>
  </h4>
  <p>Gene, Variant, Variant Group and Evidence entities can all be edited.</p>
  <h4>4. Comment on CIViC Content</h4>
  <p>Throughout the website are "Talk" pages where users can comment on the current contents of CIViC (specific Evidence, Variants or Genes) or on Suggested Changes.</p>
  <h4>5. Variant attributes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Aliases</li>
    <li>HGVS expressions</li>
    <li>Coordinates</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>6. Literature Sources</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Primary literature</li>
    <li>Reviews</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>7. Bite-size curation tasks</h4>
  <p>Only have a few minutes? Tackle one of the tasks below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a ui-sref="suggest.source" title="Suggest a Source" target="_blank">Suggest a Source</a>.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify a publication containing a variant with clinical relevance.</li>
      <li>Visit <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" title="PubMed Main Page" target="_blank">PubMed</a> to identify the publication's PubMed ID.</li>
      <li>Enter as much information possible to help curators. This form only requires 2 elements: PubMed ID and a comment to direct curators as to why you believe this publication has clinically-relevant information about a variant.</li>
      <li>Your suggested source can be seen in the <a ui-sref="curation.sources" title="Source Suggestion Queue" target="_blank">Source Suggestion Queue</a> or by searching for the publication in the <a ui-sref="search.sources" title="Source advanced search" target="_blank">Source Advanced Search</a> to find the dedicated CIViC publication page.</li>
    </ul>  
    <li>Add a variant Alias.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Browse for variants you are familiar with using our <a ui-sref="browse.variants" title="Browse CIViC Variants" target="_blank">Browse</a> or <a ui-sref="search.variants" title="Variant Advanced Search" target="_blank">Advanced Search</a> pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Read a summary for your favorite gene/variant and comment on the contents.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the <a ui-sref="browse.genes" title="Browse CIViC Genes" target="_blank">Browse</a> or <a ui-sref="search.genes" title="Gene Advanced Search" target="_blank">Advanced Search</a> pages to find your variant or gene of interest.</li>
      <li>Use the <a ui-sref="activity" title="Activity Page" target="_blank">Activity Page</a> to view recent activity. Clicking on any event will direct you to that event.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Add a Variant Type.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Using the <a href="https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/search/variants/8659ebdf-290f-4a0b-afa5-6146a3731e74" title="Variant Advanced Search - No Variant Type" target="_blank">Variant Advanced Search</a> page you can identify Variants without a Sequence Ontology Variant Type (e.g., Missense, Loss-of-function).</li>
        <li>One you have identified a variant, clicking on one of the Variants in the list will take you to that page. Next to the Variant name, you will see a pencil icon which will take you to the edit page for that Variant.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
