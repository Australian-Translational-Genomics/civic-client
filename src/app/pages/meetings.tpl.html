                <p>Precision medicine refers to the use of prevention and treatment strategies that are tailored to the
                  unique features of each individual and their disease. In the context of cancer this might involve the
                  identification of specific mutations shown to predict response to a targeted therapy. The biomedical
                  literature describing these associations is large and growing rapidly. Currently these interpretations
                  exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort.
                  Realizing precision medicine will require this information to be centralized, debated and interpreted
                  for application in the clinic. CIViC is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for
                  Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our goal is to enable precision medicine by providing
                  an educational forum for dissemination of knowledge and active discussion of the clinical significance
                  of cancer genome alterations. This hackathon and jamboree will work to establish community standards
                  in this space, introduce and engage users with the existing CIViC resource, engage in variant curation
                  activities, and improve the features, user-friendliness and utility of the CIViC curation
                  interface.</p>
                <h4 class="subsectionheader">Goals</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Establish community standards and best practices for curation of clinically actionable variants in
                    cancer.
                  </li>
                  <li>Further curation of clinically actionable variants in cancer.</li>
                  <li>Further development of the CIViC web interface for expert crowdsourcing the curation of clinically
                    actionable variants.

                    <p>This year the <a href="http://www.swat4ls.org">Semantic Web Applications and Tools for Life Sciences (SWAT4LS) Conference</a> and Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) Curation Jamboree and Hackathon are both at the NKI in Amsterdam, only separated by the weekend. This brings the opportunity for potential synergy, where content from CIViC is curated and presented in a Semantic Web-ready format, which is then integrated with other resources on the Semantic Web at SWAT4LS.</p>

                    <p>Attendance at both events would certainly benefit from such a cross-pollination. To enable this, we cordially invite attendees of SWAT4LS to join the CIViC Jamboree and Hackaton and vice versa. Joining the CIViC Jamboree/Hackaton is free of charge (please register at <a href="http://ngs2016.org">http://ngs2016.org</a>). Attendees for the CIViC Jamboree get a 20% discount when registering for SWAT4LS events (discount codes will be distributed at the CIViC Jamboree and Hackathon).</p>
