                <p>Precision medicine refers to the use of prevention and treatment strategies that are tailored to the
                  unique features of each individual and their disease. In the context of cancer this might involve the
                  identification of specific mutations shown to predict response to a targeted therapy. The biomedical
                  literature describing these associations is large and growing rapidly. Currently these interpretations
                  exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort.
                  Realizing precision medicine will require this information to be centralized, debated and interpreted
                  for application in the clinic. CIViC is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for
                  Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our goal is to enable precision medicine by providing
                  an educational forum for dissemination of knowledge and active discussion of the clinical significance
                  of cancer genome alterations. This hackathon and jamboree will work to establish community standards
                  in this space, introduce and engage users with the existing CIViC resource, engage in variant curation
                  activities, and improve the features, user-friendliness and utility of the CIViC curation
                  interface.</p>
                <h4 class="subsectionheader">Goals</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Establish community standards and best practices for curation of clinically actionable variants in
                    cancer.
                  </li>
                  <li>Further curation of clinically actionable variants in cancer.</li>
                  <li>Further development of the CIViC web interface for expert crowdsourcing the curation of clinically
                    actionable variants.

                  emphasis on hands-on activities learning to curate variants in the CIViC interface or develop the
                  CIViC code base.</p>

                <h4>Planned activities</h4>
                <p>Participants will self-form into groups to tackle domain-specific variant curation (jamboree) or new
                  website feature development (hackathon).</p>
