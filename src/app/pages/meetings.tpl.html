                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>Precision medicine refers to the use of prevention and treatment strategies that are tailored to the unique features of each individual and their disease. In the context of cancer this might involve the identification of specific mutations shown to predict response to a targeted therapy. The biomedical literature describing these associations is large and growing rapidly. Currently these interpretations exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort. Realizing precision medicine will require this information to be centralized, debated and interpreted for application in the clinic. CIViC is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our goal is to enable precision medicine by providing an educational forum for dissemination of knowledge and active discussion of the clinical significance of cancer genome alterations. This hackathon and jamboree will work to establish community standards in this space, introduce and engage users with the existing CIViC resource, engage in variant curation activities, and improve the features, user-friendliness and utility of the CIViC curation interface.</p>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Establish community standards and best practices for curation of clinically actionable variants in cancer.</li>
                  <li>Further curation of clinically actionable variants in cancer.</li>
                  <li>Further development of the CIViC web interface for expert crowdsourcing the curation of clinically actionable variants.</li>
                </ol>

                    <p><strong>Hackathon:</strong> Software developers, engineers and computational biologists interested in learning and applying back-end and front-end web development skills. Prerequisites: Familiarity with either Ruby/Rails (back-end) or Javascript/Angular (front-end) would be beneficial.</p>

                  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                    <p><strong>Curation Jamboree:</strong> Pathologists and oncologists (certified or in training), genome scientists, interested in the problem of sequence variant interpretation for cancer precision medicine. Prerequisites: Basic understanding of the genetic basis of cancer.</p>

                <h4>What to expect</h4>
                <p>The CIViC hackathon and jamboree will take the form of an unconference with some presentations and an emphasis on hands-on activities learning to curate variants in the CIViC interface or develop the CIViC code base.</p>

                <h4>Planned activities</h4>
                <p>Participants will self-form into groups to tackle domain-specific variant curation (jamboree) or new website feature development (hackathon).</p>

                <p><em>Participants must bring their own laptop in order to participate.</em></p>
