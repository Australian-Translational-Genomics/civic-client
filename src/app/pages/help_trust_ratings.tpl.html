    In order to quickly discern how much trust curators and users have in a single evidence statement, a five star trust rating system is used. Each evidence item is given a rating, from 1 to 5 stars, based on the quality of the source from which the evidence is curated. These rating depend on a number of factors, including journal impact, control quality, orthogonal validation, and reproducibility.
