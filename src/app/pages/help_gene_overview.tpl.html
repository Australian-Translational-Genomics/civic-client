  <p>Genes are the official HGNC symbols for genes with a clinical Evidence Item currently captured by the CIViC database. A new Gene record will automatically populate when an Evidence Item is assigned to a particular gene. Alternative gene names are autopopulated from MyGeneInfo and searchable throughout the database. However, new Evidence Items must be associated with an official gene symbol to reduce ambiguity.
