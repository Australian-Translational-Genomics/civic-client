  <h2>Understanding the CIViC Data Model</h2>
  <p>At the heart of CIViC is the clinical evidence statement. The clinical evidence statement is a piece of information that has been manually curated from trustable medical literature about a variant or genomic 'event' that has implications in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, or predictive response to therapy. For example, “Patients with BRAF V600 mutations respond well to the drug dabrafenib”. A variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or deletion, a chromosomal rearrangement, an RNA gene fusion, an RNA expression pattern (e.g. over-expression), and others. Each clinical evidence statement corresponds to a single citable publication.</p>

  <p>The following tables define the minimal components and definitions required for a CIViC evidence statement. Once clinical evidence statements for a variant have been curated, a summary is manually generated describing the variant's significance in cancer, along with current treatment methods. A gene level summary then synthesizes the variant summaries, and adds important gene-level information. Each variant can belong to one or more variant groups, these act to combine functionally similar variants into a single entity.  For example, 'FGFR Fusions' is a group that contains several gene fusions where FGFR2 (or FGFR3) is involved in a fusion with various 3' partner genes, and 'Imatinib Resistance Mutations' is a group of variants that confer resistance to imatinib treatment.</p>
