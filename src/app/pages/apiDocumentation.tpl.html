      <p>CIViC provides a simple API that can be utilized over HTTP in the programming language of your choice or even at the command line.</p>
      <p>
        The CIViC API attempts to be RESTful whenever appropriate which hopefully makes it intuitive to use. There are four main entities in the system that a user may interact with: Genes, Variants, Variant Groups, and Evidence Items.
        These entities form a hierarchy that is reflected in the API endpoints. A Gene has one or more Variants, each of which may have one or more Evidence Items. Variants may also be collected into Variant Groups.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h4>Genes</h4>
      <hr/>
    <pre>
<strong>GET</strong> /api/genes
<strong>GET</strong> /api/genes/:gene_id
    </pre>
      <p>
        The genes endpoint can be used to get either a list of all genes in the system, or more detailed information for a single gene using a gene_id in the url string.
        As an example, here is (clickable) sample request for the gene "BRAF" (gene_id: 5)
      </p>
    <pre>
<strong>GET</strong> <a href="/api/genes/5" target="_blank">/api/genes/5</a>
    </pre>
      <p>
        You can always use the API call one level up the hierarchy to retrieve a list of IDs for the entity you are interested in. For instance, the genes endpoint will return a list of Variant IDs for that Gene.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h4>Variants</h4>
      <hr/>
    <pre>
<strong>GET</strong> /api/genes/:gene_id/variants
    </pre>
      <p>
        The variants endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of all variants for a single gene (using an Entrez ID), or a more detailed view of a specific variant (using the Entrez ID and variant ID).
      </p>
    <pre>
<strong>GET</strong> <a href="/api/variants/5" target="_blank">/api/variants/5</a>
    </pre>
      <br/>
      <h4>Evidence Items</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>The variants endpoint may retrieve a list of evidence items linked to a variant:</p>
    <pre>
<strong>GET</strong> /api/variants/:variant_id/evidence_items
    </pre>
      <p>
        The evidence items endpoint may then be used to retrieve a more detailed view of a specific evidence_item:
      </p>
    <pre>
<strong>GET</strong> <a href="/api/evidence_items/9" target="_blank">/api/evidence_items/9</a>
    </pre>
      <br/>
      <h4>Other Features</h4>
      <hr/>
    <pre>
<strong>GET</strong> /api/genes/:gene_id/comments
<strong>GET</strong> /api/genes/:gene_id/revisions
<strong>GET</strong> /api/genes/:gene_id/suggested_changes
<strong>GET</strong> /api/genes/:gene_id/suggested_changes/:change_id/comments
    </pre>
      <p>
        Each of the four main entities in the system (Genes, Variants, Variant Groups, and Evidence Items) also support additional endpoints for comments, version history, and suggested changes.
        Suggested changes can also have comments themselves. These endpoints can be accessed by adding the appropriate resource name (comments, revisions, suggested_changes) to the end of the route for the entity that you are interested in.
        For example, to get a list of revisions for the gene "BRAF":
      </p>
    <pre>
<strong>GET</strong> <a href="/api/genes/5/revisions" target="_blank">/api/genes/5/revisions</a>
    </pre>
      <p>
        We are working on additional API support and documentation. Soon, you will be able to do anything you do from the site (add comments, suggest new evidence items, etc) directly from the API.
