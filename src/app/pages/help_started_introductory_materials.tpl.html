  <h4>The Cancer Analysis Bottleneck</h4>
  <p>With the speed at which cancer sequencing data is being produced and the rapidly reduced costs associated with this endeavor, the most significant bottleneck is interpreting the clinical significance of cancer variants from the wealth of existing and rapidly evolving medical literature.</p>
  <p>Interpretation requires bringing together multiple types of information from preclinical lab experiments to clinical trial resuts. However, additional challeneges remain in appropriately associating variants in the literature to curator-generated interpretations.</p>

  <h4>Cancer Variant Interpretation - Evidence Statements, Variant Summaries and Gene Summaries</h4>
  <p>For a primer on the fundamentals of cancer variant interpretation, we highly recommend that new users start by reading the CIViC paper and three recently published Standards and Guidelines proposals:
