  <h3>The CIViC Ecosystem of Collaborators, Moderators and Other Stakeholders</h3>
  <p>The CIViC project aims to facilitate a collaborative ecosystem of research scientists, clinical scientists, and patient advocates dedicated to curating an accurate and relevant database of clinical interpretations of cancer variants. The diagram below shows how the various stakeholders in the CIViC ecosystem collaborate to curate the database.</p>

  <h3>The CIViC Collaborative Process</h3>
  <p>The CIViC application encourages and facilitates collaboration through a multi-step process where curators add, edit, discuss, and approve additions and revisions to evidence items. The following flowchart shows how this collaborative process works, and where each stakeholder plays a role.</p>

  <h3>The CIViC Data Model</h3>
  <p>The CIViC database is based on Evidence Items which reference their parent Variants, Variant Groups, and Genes. You may explore the various CIViC entities and their attribute using the menu to your left (or above, if you're viewing this on a mobile display).</p>
