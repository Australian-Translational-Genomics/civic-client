      <p><strong>Advancing Cancer Precision Medicine with Community Collaboration</strong><br/>
        Precision medicine refers to the use of prevention and treatment strategies that are tailored to the unique features of each individual and their disease. In the context of cancer this might involve the identification of specific mutations shown to predict response to a targeted therapy. The biomedical literature describing these associations is large and growing rapidly. Currently these interpretations exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort. Realizing precision medicine will require this information to be centralized, debated and interpreted for application in the clinic. CIViC is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our goal is to enable precision medicine by providing an educational forum for dissemination of knowledge and active discussion of the clinical significance of cancer genome alterations.</p>

      <p><strong>How our Collaborative Process is Different</strong><br/>
        All content created in CIViC is, and will continue to be, freely available, with minimal restriction (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0</a>). Anyone can contribute to CIViC by simply registering for an account. Users join the community with "Curator" level privileges that allow them to comment or propose additions or revisions on any knowledge in CIViC. Proposed additions and revisions are then reviewed by users with "Editor" level privileges before entering the public CIViC record. Community curators work together with editors towards comprehensive and accurate interpretations of the clinical relevance of variants in cancer.</p>

      <p><h4><a name="domain-experts" id="domain-experts" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Domain Experts</a></h4></p>
      <p>Our <em>Domain Experts</em> serve a critical function in the <a ui-sref="community.main"> CIViC community</a>. Normally editor-level users, they are tasked with promoting and maintaining high quality data and interpretations in CIViC. Domain Experts are usually scientists or physician scientists, with advanced degrees (PhD or MD level), and demonstrated expertise (publication records) relevant to curation of knowledge for precision medicine in cancer. Domain Experts will typically take responsibility for curating the literature related to a specific cancer type, gene/pathway, or mutation type. They also are responsible for approving any new submissions or revisions from other curators in their domain area. Domain Experts come from two sources. First, individuals with established expertise in the field of precision medicine or domain expertise for a specific domain are identified and invited to join the CIViC community at the Domain Expert level. Alternatively, individuals may be promoted to Domain Expert level based on expertise demonstrated through an exceptional contribution history in CIViC.</p>
