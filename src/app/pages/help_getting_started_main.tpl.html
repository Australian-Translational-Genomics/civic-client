  <h3 class="subtitle">Getting started as a CIViC Curator</h3>
  <p>CIViC curators are a community of users dedicated to improving the CIViC knowledgebase and its contents.</p>
    <p>Prerequisites:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an account. Process requires login creditials for a supported OAuth provider (Google, ORCiD or GitHub).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Although curators are not required any specific training, background or skill set, curator-generated content can only be "Accepted" once it is reviewed by a CIViC Editor. Editors are experts in cancer genomics, oncologists and other related fields or diseases. This gate-keeper model allows significant contributions from curators with any level of experience while maintaining the quality of an expert-driven resource. Curators can be promoted to Editors once they have demonstrated an aptitude and understanding of the CIViC data model and requirements of cancer variant interpretation.</p>
  <p>Whether through streamlining the wording of a variant interpretation, the addition of valid IDs or aliases, identification of key literature sources, small contributions from many curators can make a big impact on how up-to-date and comprehensive the CIViC resource is.</p>
