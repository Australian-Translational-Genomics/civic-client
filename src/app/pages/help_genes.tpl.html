  <h3 class="subtitle">Genes in the CIViC Database</h3>
  <p>CIViC provides a user-written and curated summary of the clinical relevance of genes, as well as data pulled from the MyGeneInfo database. The gene summary includes the gene's relevance to different cancer types, patient outcomes and treatment decisions and highlight differences and similarities between different variants of this gene. It may also include information about the gene product's pathway interactions, functional alterations caused by variants within the gene and normal functions that are relevant to its association with cancer.</p>
