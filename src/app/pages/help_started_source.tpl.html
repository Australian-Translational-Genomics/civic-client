  New CIViC curators, commonly ask where they should focus their efforts and where can they find evidence of the clinical significance of cancer variants. There are many approaches and relevant resources that may help to identify and prioritize such evidence.</p>
  <p> 
  Remember that the focus of CIViC is on the <strong>clinical</strong> relevance of <strong>cancer</strong> variants. Before expending the effort to propose an addition to CIViC, ask yourself would a clinician potentially find this information useful in understanding and treating a patient's cancer? Could an oncologist use this evidence to better understand likely response to therapy (Predictive evidence), or outcome (Prognostic) for their patient? Would a pathologist find knowledge of the variant valuable in classifying (Diagnostic) the tumor into a subtype? Would a medical geneticist or genetic counselor be interested in the causative (Predisposing) significance of this evidence? In addressing these questions, try to think about the distinction between the relevance of a variant to cancer biology and its relevance in a clinical setting. A variant may have great and diverse relevance to the biology of a cancer cell but have limited or no clinical applicability. For example, TP53 mutations are critical in many cancers and hundreds (if not thousands) of papers have been written about their complex roles in cancer biology. However, the scenarios in which TP53 mutations are <strong>clinically</strong> relevant are much, much narrower. A variant may NOT be clinically relevant despite being characterized as functional (gain or loss of function), a 'driver', 'recurrent', etc. In some, perhaps most cases, the clinical relevance of these variants may simply not be established yet. However, CIViC is about the <strong>evidence that establishes their clinical relevance</strong>. By contrast, in some cases, the biological relevance may be poorly understood while clinical utlity is established. Such evidence does belong in CIViC. A mechanistic understanding is desirable, but not required. This description is an oversimplification. There are many nuances to be discussed. In many cases, clinical interpretation and utility is open to debate. We welcome this debate and one of the goals of CIViC is to enable and capture it. If you believe some evidence is relevant to CIViC but have some doubts, please submit it so that the community can discuss with you.</p>

The following list is not exhaustive but provides many examples of approaches to identify high quality evidence. If you know of a useful resource that is not listed below, please let us know about it.</p>

  <h4>Example sources of CIViC evidence and high priority variants</h4>
  <p>
  <ul>
