        <p>CIViC is a community-edited forum for discussion and interpretation of peer-reviewed publications pertaining to the clinical relevance of variants (or biomarker alterations) in cancer. These interpretations may include associations between molecular alterations (or lack of alteration) and one or more drugs, diagnoses, prognoses or other treatment decision. These interpretations of clinical significance (or lack of clinical significance) are purely for research purposes. A finding of no interpretation does not necessarily indicate lack of relevance for any specific variant or biomarker alteration. Interpretations are not presented in ranked order of potential or predicted importance.These interpretations make no promise or guarantee of any clinical benefit (or lack of clinical benefit).</p>
