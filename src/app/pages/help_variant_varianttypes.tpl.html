  Variant types are used to classify variants within the structured ontology terms provided by <a href='http://www.sequenceontology.org/index.html'>The Sequence Ontology Project</a>. Multiple terms for a variant are allowed to facilitate functional and structural effects of the variant. Ideally, the most specific child terms of a branch are used. These variant types can be used to search for variants within the CIViC database that meet a users' criteria via the advanced search page or through the API.</p>
