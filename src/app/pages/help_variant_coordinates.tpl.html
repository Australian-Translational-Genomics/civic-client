  Genomic coordinates in CIViC are a single representation of the genomic alteration that can lead to a specific variant. Multiple genomic alterations may lead to the same variant (i.e., several changes at the basepair level can lead to the same amino acid change); however, CIViC currently provides only one possible example.

  <h4>General Guidelines</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose one representative variant per gene.</li>
    <li>Coordinates are 1-based.</li>
    <li>Currently supports reference genome build 37.</li>
    <li>Representative transcripts are from Ensembl.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Include both transcript (e.g., ENST00000078429.1) & database version (e.g., 75)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The start is always the numerically smaller coordinate.</li>
    <li>Complexities can be documented in the variant comments section.</li>
    <li>For fusions:</li>
    <ul>
	<li>The fusion variant is entered under only one gene. Choose the 'important' gene. Often, but not always, this is the 3' gene.</li>
	<li>The variant name is always 5' partner - 3' partner</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h4>Selecting a representative transcript</h4>
  <p>A representative transcript is a single transcript model used as an example or reference point. It is used to define the genomic coordinates for the variant. We present a single representative transcript that contains the variant of interest that ideally can be exported using the API and converted bioinformatically to desired outputs.</p>
  <p>Features of a representative transcript:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is no one 'right' answer for representative transcript.</li>
    <li>It must:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>contain the variant.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>It should:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>be from Ensembl archived version 75 including transcript versions (i.e., ENST00000078429.1 instead of ENST00000078429) whenever possible.</li>
        <li>be a transcript that is in our IGV reference transcript file. 
            <ul>
            <li>This file is a custom gene track file that can be loaded in IGV for review of coordinates.</li>
            <li>It is based on a specific version of Ensembl (v75) and contains both transcript IDs and transcript version numbers.</li>
            <li>Ensembl defined ’<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Glossary?id=346">canonical transcripts</a>' are highlighted with asterisks (***ENST00000078429.1.v75***) as a suggestion when no specific transcript is otherwise indicated.</li>
            <li>The reference transcript file can be obtained from the <a href="https://github.com/genome/civic-server">civic-server git repository</a> (~/civic-server/public/downloads/Ensembl-v75_build37-hg19_UcscGenePred_CIViC-Genes.ensGene)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    <li>It may:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>be the transcript with the longest ORF or most exons.</li>
        <li>be the transcript that contains the 'canonical exons’ that are used in many transcripts.</li>
        <li>be the variant that has the greatest outer coordinates.</li>
        <li>be the transcript that is widely used in literature.</li>
        <li>be a transcript that is compatible with interpretation/visualization in the literature (source paper for evidence statements).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Ensembl IDs should be used whenever possible and should be from archived version 75 including transcript versions (i.e., ENST00000078429.1 instead of ENST00000078429).
</li>
    <li>It should be a transcript that is in our IGV reference transcript file. This file is a custom gene track file that can be loaded in IGV for review of coordinates. It is based on a specific version of Ensembl (v75) and contains both transcript IDs and transcript version numbers. To aid the identification of a representative transcript, Ensembl defined ’<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Glossary?id=346">canonical transcripts</a>' have been indicated with asterisks (***ENST00000078429.1.v75***) which can be used unless rationale exists that this is inappropriate for a specific variant. The reference transcript file can be obtained from the <a href="https://github.com/genome/civic-server">civic-server git repository</a> (~/civic-server/public/downloads/Ensembl-v75_build37-hg19_UcscGenePred_CIViC-Genes.ensGene)</li>

  <h4>Selecting variant coordinates based on variant type</h4>
  <p>Start and stop positions are dependent upon the reference genome and the specific isoform/transcript being used.</p>
