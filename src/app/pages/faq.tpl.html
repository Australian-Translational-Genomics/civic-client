<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<pre>
<i>What is CIViC?</i>
	
	CIViC is a database of the <b>C</b>linical <b>I</b>nterpretations of <b>V</b>ariants <b>i</b>n <b>C</b>ancer. It is an open, crowdsourced database...... PUT PURPOSE STATEMENT HERE....
	
<i>Why crowdsourcing?</i>

	Let's talk about clean, precise answers to all these questions. 
	
<i>What is a <b>Variant</b>?</i>

	A variant in CIViC is any genomic alteration. This includes single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion events (indels), copy number alterations (CNV's), structural variants (SVs), and other events that differ from the "normal" genome. 
	
<i>What is an <b>Evidence Statement</b>?</i>

	An evidence statement is an idea from a published source. It captures a variant's impact on clinical action, which can either be predictive of therapy, correlated with prognostic outcome, or inform disease diagnosis.
	
<i>How is this information organized?</i>
	
	An in-depth description of the data model behind CIViC can be found <a href="https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/help"> here</a>. 
	
<i>What information is currently in CIViC?</i>

	CIViC currently houses over 450 evidence statements about 125 variants in 50 genes across 40 cancers, and these numbers are growing rapidly with your help!
	
<i>How do I contribute information?</i>

	The <i>Collaborate</i> tab details the curation process, with links for adding and editing information. We also have screencasts and walk-throughs to help guide you in your curating efforts!
	
<i>My favorite Gene/Variant is not in CIViC?!?!?</i>

	Unfortunately, because all of this information is manually curated, we have not been able to populate every published evidence item from every variant and every gene. Fortunately, there are people like you that are interested in helping us add this information! In order for a gene or variant to appear in CIViC, it must have an evidence statement (or many!) associated with it. To add evidence statements, go <a href="https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/collaborate"> here</a>!
	
<i>Why must my changes be approved by a moderator before I can see them?</i>

	In an effort to reduce spam, we require that edits be commit to the review queue before they are shown on the live server. But don't worry! The review process is quick. You will see your hardwork and determination pay off in no time!
	
<i>What is a Disease Ontology ID (DOID)?</i>

	In order to provide a structured representation of the diseases associated with evidence statements, we ask that you provide a disease ontology ID from <a href="http://disease-ontology.org/"> http://disease-ontology.org/ </a>. This allows for consistent representation, and minimizes ambiguity when referring to diseases. 

<i>What is a PubChem ID (PCID)?</i>

	Much like the reasoning behind the DOID, providing a PubChem ID with your evidence item allows us to easily avoid ambiguity within drug naming. As a default, drug compound names are used instead of branded trade names in an effort to be as consistent as possible. PubChem ID's can be found by searching the compound <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"> here</a>.
